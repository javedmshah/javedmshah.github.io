***Delegated and Chained Authorization with OAuth2 and User Managed Access***
[sinconf-delegated-authz](/sinconf-delegated-authz.pdf){:target="_blank"}<br>
Submitted to Security of Information Networks SIN18, _rejected with review comments._<br>
\[_I have not had the time to revise and resubmit since, but SIN24 is around the corner and I shall give it another try with revisions._\]
