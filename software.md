This repository contains an environment variable-based configuration for the sample Identity Microservices built on Kubernetes. The initial configuration can be used with the public bintray docker repository when deploying the early-access microservices docker images.

Use this repository as a starting point for your own custom configuration using environment variables for sample Identity Microservices. Sequence diagrams are included in this repository. The code is not supported anymore and is only there for sample purposes.
