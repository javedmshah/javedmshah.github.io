#### Surveying exploitation of labor in the aftermath of Covid19

**Abstract**. &mdash; <br>
We develop a theory of policy-subversive quantum algorithms (PSQAs): circuits
that employ a policy-defined violation oracle to discover prohibited state–action pairs
while attempting to evade detection. Our contributions are threefold. (i) We formal-
ize a provenance model that cryptographically binds an oracle to a policy grammar
and enforces a Reflection API for state-reflection primitives. (ii) We design and
analyze two policy-grade detectors. Detector D ∗ 1 is a compile-/trace-level test
that recognizes Grover-like discovery via structural alternation between the signed
violation oracle and registered state-reflections; under the API constraints, we prove
completeness (no false negatives on amplitude amplification/estimation) and give ex-
ponentially decaying false-positive bounds. Detector D∗2 is a quantum-native spectral
test that uses short amplitude estimation on the composed iterate Q = R ∗ ψUV to
certify the presence of marked-set dynamics; we quantify its query complexity for dis-
tinguishing k = 0 versus k ≥ k ∗ min. (iii) We prove an impossibility result: without
provenance and reflection constraints, any black-box detector distinguishing Grover-
like discovery from non-amplifying behavior with constant bias requires Ω(√N/k)
queries, i.e., as hard as unstructured search. We also give policy-subversive construc-
tions (QSVT/LCU packing, fixed-point schedules, and variational camouflage) and
discuss how D2 defeats them
