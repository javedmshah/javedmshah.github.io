**Fixed Effects Logistic Model **. &mdash; <br>
Mixed model analysis was used by related studies on social conflict and religious hegemony to provide generalized and flexible approaches to document the effects of regime on conflict. The logistic fixed effects model created in this research confirms the robustness of the results from the mixed effects models. The fixed effects model does show a change in the directionality and significance levels of some of the control variables. The inverted U-shape curve or the nonlinear effect confirms earlier findings and adds credence to theory of religious hegemony as being related to changing political institutions, and also as being causal in nature to conflict.
