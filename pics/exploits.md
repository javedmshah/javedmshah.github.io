#### Surveying exploitation of labor in the aftermath of Covid19

**Study of trafficking dynamics**. &mdash; <br>
The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected marginalized communities and
exacerbated socio-economic vulnerabilities, thereby increasing the risk of human trafficking. This
systematic literature review examined the impact of the pandemic on human trafficking in
India and the US, focusing on trends, vulnerabilities, and victim profiles during and post-
pandemic periods. We conducted quantitative analysis of trends from the Counter-Trafficking Data Collaborative (CTDC) Global K-anon Dataset, version 20210825.
The scope of this research is focused on analyzing the transformation in trafficking dynamics due to the pandemic. It assesses how victim profiles have diversified, methods of trafficking have evolved, and exploitation has intensified or changed in nature due to altered social and economic conditions. By doing so, the paper contributes to a nuanced understanding of the intersection between a global health crisis and human trafficking, offering insights to inform policies and interventions. <br> <br>
***Post COVID sub-exploitation map using a multipartite graph***<br>
Using the CTDC data, which includes anonymized data on identified trafficking cases, we mapped victim profiles by country of citizenship, trafficking routes, and exploitation types. Data was stratified by country, victim demographics, type of trafficking, and outcomes to provide a comparative insight into the prevalence and characteristics of trafficking in the United States and India.

We highlighted contextual differences and the shared challenges faced by both countries, underscoring the need for adaptive strategies and innovative solutions to combat human trafficking effectively. We organized the data by country of citizenship, and mapped all the cases of exploitation to USA and India. Further, we aggregated the major themes and counted all cases up to and just before the covid outbreak, and separately, after the outbreak. The data also included the means of exploitation, such as false promises, denial of basic needs, etc. Presented here in a multipartite graphical model is the subset with the highest frequencies in the original dataset.  <br><br>

This research also explores specific changes in trafficking patterns in India and the USA, highlighting how the pandemic has shifted victim profiles, trafficking methods, and exploitation types. The research aims to uncover how these shifts have resulted from pandemic-induced vulnerabilities and the opportunistic adaptations by traffickers exploiting these conditions. The unique conditions created by the COVID-19 pandemic have provided
an opportunity to examine how legislative frameworks in both countries have responded to the pandemic's challenges related to human trafficking. We mapped out the relative density of human trafficking between all the countries studied, weighted by the number of people that were exploited. The study acknowledges potential limitations, including variability in the data quality and availability between the United States and India, and the challenges of interpreting legal texts from different legal systems.
