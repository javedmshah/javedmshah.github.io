#### Surveying exploitation of labor in the aftermath of Covid19

**Study of exploitation**. &mdash; <br><br>
***Network mapping using multipartite graphs***<br>
We organized the data by country of citizenship, and mapped all the cases of exploitation to USA and India. Further, we aggregated the major themes and counted all cases up to and just before the covid outbreak, and separately, after the outbreak. The data also included the means of exploitation, such as false promises, denial of basic needs, etc. Presented here in a multipartite graphical model is the subset with the highest frequencies in the original dataset, CTDC Global K-anon Dataset, version 20210825. <br>

The second presentation is that of a network of all countries that exploited people from USA and India. Themes that emerge from the data include forced labor and sexual exploitation. The connections between the countries are weighted by the number of people that were exploited.<br>
