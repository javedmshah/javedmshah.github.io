#### Surveying exploitation of labor in the aftermath of Covid19

**Abstract**. &mdash; <br>
We study continuous, adversarially robust control of distributed quantum
substrates that must operate without measurement-induced interruptions. Our
first contribution is an ancilla-safe weak-monitoring layer: via a Naimark dila-
tion, each agent couples a fresh monitor ancilla to its data qubit and measures
only the ancilla, thereby reproducing a symmetric weak POVM on the data
without collapsing the live register. These telemetry signals can be privately
aggregated (e.g., via MPC) to trigger remediation.
Our second contribution is a fully unitary, measurement-free greedy Lya-
punov healing procedure that provably decreases a composite Lyapunov func-
tional at every cycle. Working in the density-matrix model, we give closed-form
angles for (i) local single-qubit alignment that minimizes each site’s excited-
population term, and (ii) conditional pairwise controlled rotations that reduce
joint |11〉 mass along an interaction graph. Each substep is an exact minimizer
for its targeted term and leaves non-targeted terms invariant, implying mono-
tone descent. We provide a two-agent worked example in density matrices and
a general n-agent formulation.
Together, ancilla-safe monitoring and greedy Lyapunov healing yield a non-
destructive, streaming-compatible framework for resilient quantum services—e.g.,
smart-vehicle substrates and censorship-resilient secure messaging—supporting
continuous anomaly detection (telemetry) and autonomous recovery (unitary
control)
